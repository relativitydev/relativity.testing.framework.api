# Contributing to Relativity Testing Framework Api

Welcome to the Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api repository.

Please review the [Relativity.Testing.Framework contributing guide](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), if you have not already.

Be aware that this repository relies heavily on [Models](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/tree/master/source/Relativity.Testing.Framework/Models) and [Mapping](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/tree/master/source/Relativity.Testing.Framework/Mapping) from the Relativity.Testing.Framework library.
If you are adding or making changes to any of the services or strategies that use them, it's possible that you will need to make a change to Relativity.Testing.Framework first.
For this reason, all builds of Relativity.Testing.Framework publish a package to Artifactory.

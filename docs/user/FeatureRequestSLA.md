# Feature Request SLA

This document describes the feature request process.

## Feature Request Process

1. A feature is requested using the issue tracker in either the [Relativity.Testing.Framework](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/issues/new?&labels=enhancement&template=feature_enhancement.yml) or [Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework.api/issues/new?&labels=enhancement&template=feature_enhancement.yml) repositories.
2. A maintainer will follow up on the issue asking for more information if necessary.
3. Feature Requests will be prioritized based on many criteria including, but not limited to: :+1: reactions, size, and estimated effort.
4. The maintainers will work on feature requests within our scope of influence as time and priority permit.
   1. We encourage consumers of these repositories to [contribute](https://github.com/relativitydev/relativity.testing.framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions) where appropriate to foster a collaborative community.
5. A maintainer will follow up on the issue when it is complete with information about the changes, and the package that contains them.

We have some support for most of the [Relativity Platform APIs](https://platform.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Relativity_Platform/Platform_APIs.htm).

For the current list of supported operations, [check API Services documentation](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity.testing.framework.api/api/Relativity.Testing.Framework.Api.Services.html).

If you notice an endpoint is missing that you would like to consume, please open an issue or pull request for the requested feature.
